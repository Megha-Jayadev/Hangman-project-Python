# Hangman-Beginner project-Python

This project aims at creating a "guess the word" game.
- The user needs to be able to input letter guesses.
- A limit is also set on how many guesses they can use.
- Keep notifying the user of the remaining turns.
- One who guess the letters within limit range will win the game.
